    title: 'Greeting & Purpose',
    narrative: `Hello! I'm calling from NxtWave, your course activation expert. This call is about helping you complete the final step so your learning journey can begin. You've already taken a smart first move by reserving your seat — let's make sure it's activated today.`,

    id: OnboardingStage.PAYMENT,
    title: 'Payment Options',
    narrative: `We have three simple options to get started — 1. Full payment, if you prefer completing it in one go. 2. Credit card payment, if you want flexible billing. 3. Or the most popular — 0% interest EMI through our NBFC partners — where you can pay in easy monthly installments without paying a single rupee extra. Most parents and students choose the 0% EMI plan since it's convenient, affordable, and helps you begin immediately. Which one do you prefer?`,

    id: OnboardingStage.NBFC,
    title: 'Why NBFCs (Trust & Transparency)',
    narrative: `We've partnered with trusted NBFCs registered under RBI — like Feemonk, GyanDhan, Bajaj, and Varthana — to make the process safe, transparent, and quick. These partners handle the loan processing digitally, while NxtWave focuses fully on your training and placement journey. It's a 0% interest plan, meaning you pay the same total amount — just split into easy EMIs. There's no hidden charge, no paperwork, and approval takes less than a few minutes once documents are ready.`,

    id: OnboardingStage.RCA,
    title: 'Right Co-Applicant Identification',
    narrative: `To make the approval smooth, we'll need a Right Co-Applicant — someone in your family with a regular income and active bank account. Usually, parents or siblings are the best fit. We'll just need 3 things: their PAN, Aadhaar, and bank proof — and a quick 15-second confirmation video. Everything's 100% digital and secure. Once we upload these, the loan gets approved almost instantly, and your seat is locked for onboarding. Let's finalize your co-applicant now — who in your family can we proceed with?`,
